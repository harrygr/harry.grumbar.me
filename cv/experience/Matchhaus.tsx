        is a network for sports teams. It allows players to plan and manage
        their matches, engage in team ceremonies, and dig into each others stats
        and performances.

        I created Matchhaus as a side project with a friend back in 2019 and
        worked on it full time for a period of around six months. We've managed
        to accumulate several thousand regular active users, including a number
        of paid subscribers, and raised enough capital to sustain the product
        for the forseeable future.
