        is a network for sports teams. It allows players to plan and manage
        their matches, engage in team ceremonies, and dig into each others stats
        and performances.

        I created Matchhaus as a side project with a friend back in 2019 and
        have been working on it full time since October 2021. We've managed to
        accumulate several thousand regular active users, including a number of
        paid subscribers.
