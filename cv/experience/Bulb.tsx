      <p>
        Bulb is a renewable energy provider that heavily relies on its
        technology to differentiate itself from the competition. Among the first
        full-time engineers to be hired I've built products serving millions of
        users as well as helped shaped the engineering culture while the company
        went though a period of hyper-growth.
      </p>

      <p>A few of the projects and responsibilities I've been involved with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed and evolved Bulb's core member-facing account products, with
          a focus on accessibility, security, and performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and built a new business-critical payment system (Bulb Pay)
          to allow members to effortlessly make payments on their accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Re-architected and designed new authentication infrastructure to allow
          members to access their Bulb accounts more easily and securely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built complex automation to improve revenue collection and keep member
          account balances healthy. These services involved processing large
          volumes of data efficiently and reconciling state changes between
          runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Been extensively involved in technical hiring and interviewing, and
          mentoring junior developers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
