      <p>
        Bulb is a renewable energy provider that heavily relies on its
        technology to differentiate itself from the competition. Among the first
        full-time engineers to be hired I've worked across a number of areas of
        the business delivering software and working cross-functionally to help
        shape and develop new products.
      </p>
      <p>
        We make extensive use of data to drive the way we design features. New
        features are often rolled out as experiments using toggles while we
        measure their performance.
      </p>

      <p>A few of the projects and responsibilities I've been involved with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed and built a new business-critical payment system (Bulb Pay)
          on urgent timelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Re-architected and designed new authentication infrastructure to allow
          members to access their Bulb accounts more easily and securely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built complex back-end tasks to detect and manage revenue-related
          issues. These jobs involved processing large volumes of data
          efficiently and reconciling state changes between runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Been extensively involved in techical hiring and interviewing, and
          mentoring junior developers.
        </li>
      </ul>
