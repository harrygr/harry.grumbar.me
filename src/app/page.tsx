        Hi, I'm Harry, a London-based software engineer who loves using
        technology to build incredible products that people love to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm currently working on building{" "}

        , a network for team sport.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my previous role I worked at{" "}
        <a
          href="https://bulb.co.uk"
          target="_blank"
          title="Bulb"

          Bulb
        </a>{" "}
        when it was the fastest growing company in the UK. I spent over 3 years
        building Bulb's core member-facing products, new payment systems,
        security &amp; fraud prevention, and revenue assurance automation as the
        company went through a period of hyper-growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my time at Bulb their member base increased from 100,000 to over
        1.6 million.
      </p>

      <p>
        And before that I worked at{" "}
        <a href="https://goodlord.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Goodlord
        </a>
        , a proptech startup, building tools to streamline and take the pain out
        of renting a home. During my time I helped replatform their core tenancy
        service and build their new referencing system.
